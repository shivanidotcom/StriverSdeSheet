Given a Directed Graph with V vertices (Numbered from 0 to V-1) and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not.


Example 1:

Input:



Output: 1
Explanation: 3 -> 3 is a cycle

Example 2:

Input:


Output: 0
Explanation: no cycle in the graph

====================================================
This is bit complex when compare to "DETECT CYCLE IN UNDIRECTED GRAPH"
-> The approach what we have used in "detect cycle in undirected graph" is not going to work. Hence the modified solution is below with time complexity of O(V+E)
